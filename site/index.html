					<h2>Why are the Clown Doctors now called Aoife’s Clown Doctors? Who is Aoife?</h2>
					<p>
						Very good questions.
						<br />
						Aoife is Aoife Hendrick of course.
						The Clown Doctors are now sponsored by the charity <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofaoifehendrick/about/" target="blank">“Friends of Aoife Hendrick”</a>.
						<br />
						Here are a few words about Aoife written by her mam Aine:
					</p>
					<i>
						<p>
							Aoife was such a happy healthy little girl. Full of fun with an amazing imagination. She was born in August 2007 and she melted our hearts every day.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							On May 15th 2012 she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. She was 4yrs old then, the perfect little girl and she was suddenly catapulted into a world of illness and fear. We were transferred to St. John's Ward in Crumlin that very day and chemotherapy treatment commenced within days. Chemotherapy is harsh and Aoife was plagued with infections. This meant she spent most of the summer of 2012 as an inpatient in St.Johns.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							It is hard keeping a child's spirits up in such circumstances & Aoife found it harder & harder to smile as she endured many setbacks that Summer. It was heartbreaking for us as parents to see her become even angry at times.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							But thankfully at that time the clown doctors visited the ward every week & sometimes even twice a week. Aoife's face lit up just knowing they were on the ward! She waited with impatient anticipation until it was her turn to receive their undivided attention. They told jokes, made fun of her daddy (who had told her he had been a clown when he was young!)& did magic tricks & she loved every minute of it. Her eyes shone brightly & we heard her amazing hearty laugh which let us all escape from the reality of the situation for a little while. By the end of the summer she was keeping them on their toes if their routine wasn't up to her high standards & they loved her interaction with them.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Aoife's condition had improved towards the end of August and her long term chances of beating her cancer had improved a lot. She had been released from Crumlin and was home, about to start her first day in school. We were so filled with pride at what she had come through to that point and we had allowed ourselves to hope again. Aoife's endurance and ability to smile on the good days was simply a wonder. Then on a routine visit to Crumlin, Aoife's heart stopped on August 30th 2012, she had just turned 5yrs. Our little sweetheart had left us and our lives were devastated.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Aoife remains a vital part of our family & she has 2 younger sisters & a younger brother. On May 2014 we organised an event for friends & family to gather on the 2nd anniversary date of her diagnosis, to remember our little sweetheart Aoife & to celebrate her life.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We had heard at this stage that the funds for the clown doctors were cut & they no longer visited Crumlin. We decided then, as part of that event, to try & raise enough to get the clown doctors back on the wards for the Summer of 2014.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							As it happened we raised enough to keep them visiting St Johns once a week since that first walk took place.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Aoife's Walk has become an annual event & others have organised cake sales & run marathons to help us.
							Recently the funding has allowed us to increase their visits and the clown doctors now visit the cardiac ward every week too.
						</p>
						
						<p>

								We are so proud that Aoife's love of fun & laughter is spreading to all these sick children.
								<br />
								Aoife lives on through these smiles.
