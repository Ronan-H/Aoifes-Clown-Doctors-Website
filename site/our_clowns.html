								<span class="answer-char">A:</span> I'd give loads to Aoife's Clown Doctors Ireland and other charities. I'd pay my family's mortgages and billls. I'd also travel to see my best friend in Sydney and bring him for dinner (maybe ice cream too!). I'd buy some red shoes, a new car and take time to write a play and a TV series.

							<span class="doctor-question">
								<span class="question-char">Q:</span> Where is your favourite place to go on holiday?
							</span>
							<br />
							<span class="doctor-answer">
								<span class="answer-char">A:</span> I love going to camp sites, not camping mind (Dr D. Licious is too cute for that kind of messing). I prefer to stay in mobile homes or caravans by the beach. I Lâ™¡VE the sound of the sea and building sandcastles and the funniest part is try to get rid of all the sand so it doesn't end up in your bed. Plus fish and chips with ice-cream rock when at the beach even if theyâ€™re extra crispy â€˜cos the wind blows sand on themâ€¦. adds to the flavour and crunch if you ask me.

							<br />
							<span class="doctor-answer">
								<span class="answer-char">A:</span> I would love to have the super powers that all the children in hospital have â€˜cos they are fearless, strong, kind, caring, funny and complete fighters. I don't know how they do itâ€¦ I'm sometimes scared of my own shadow, so I'd love some of their powers.ðŸ’ª
