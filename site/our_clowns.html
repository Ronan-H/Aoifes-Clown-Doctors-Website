I prefer to stay in mobile homes or caravans by the beach. I L‚ô°VE the sound of the sea and building sandcastles and the funniest part is try to get rid of all the sand so it doesn't end up in your bed. Plus fish and chips with ice-cream rock when at the beach even if they‚Äôre extra crispy ‚Äòcos the wind blows sand on them‚Ä¶. adds to the flavour and crunch if you ask me.
