					<h2>About us</h2>
					The Clown Doctors have been bringing their mad cap comedy and high energy antics to wards and waiting rooms in Crumlin and Temple Street Children's Hospitals since 2005. We go bed to bed spreading magic, fun and laughter and in so doing relieve stress for children, parents and staff in the hospitals. We are now sponsored by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofaoifehendrick/about/" target="_blank">Friends of Aoife Hendrick.</a>

					<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					<p>Aoife’s clown doctors aim to spread happiness through the wards and corridors of Ireland’s children’s hospital wards. We want to reduce the stress and anxiety of the hospital setting and transport the children to a world of wonder and fun.</p>

					<h2>Our Vision</h2>
					<p>At present we are visiting Crumlin twice weekly and attend Temple Street Hospital as part of their monthly Saturday club. We envisage increasing our visits to Temple Street Hospital and commencing visits to Tallaght Hospital. We then hope to extend our services to the children’s wards of other Regional Hospitals in Ireland.</p>
