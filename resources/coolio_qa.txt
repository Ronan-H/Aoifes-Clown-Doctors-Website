It's Friday again!! So here is the Clown Doctor to be met today:
Dr Coolio. 
He's so cool I had to defrost the words he wrote.

Q. What is your favourite colour?
A. Yo yo yo, blue because anything cool is blue. Like the cold tap and the Irish Sea.

Q. What would your best invention be?
A. I’d invent something I could listen to my music on while walking. I’d call it a walkman.....what do you mean that’s already been invented. What? What’s an iPod?


Q. Are you a dog or a cat person?
A. I’m a dog person. It’s cool when a dog fetches things for you. I asked a dog to fetch me a stick once. He brought me back a brick. We laughed.


Q. If you won the Lotto, what would you spend the money on?
A. I’d buy a mega super duper sound system. So if ever I go to space I could still hear my music from Planet Earth

Q. We know your Clown Doctor name, but what would your DJ name be?
A. DJ “Making your music dreams come true”. It’s long but I think it really gets across what I’m all about.


Q. What type of potato would you be?
A. I’d be my Mam’s mashed potato because everyone knows my Mam’s mashed potato is the best. Her secret ingredient is love, but also butter. Lots of butter.

Q. Where is your favourite place to go on holiday?
A. I don’t know if you can holiday here, but ‘In the Night Garden’ looks like a pretty relaxing place to go. I want to meet Iggle Piggle.


Q. If you could be a farmer what would be on your farm?
A. I’d have Old McDonald over to give him a break. He’s a very busy man on his farm and I’m sure he could teach me a thing or two.

Q. What happens if Pinocchio says “My nose is going to grow now”?
I A. know he’s been lying to me and he did eat my sandwiches. That is not cool Pinocchio.

Q. What super-power would you like to have?
A. I already have a super power. It’s the power to be the coolest Clown Doctor ever and I use my powers everyday!
